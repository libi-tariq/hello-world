# hello-world
This is where I will experiment with the coding I learn. This is not my central coding hub; it is one of many that I will use. I will further my interest in coding and take advantage of that interest by coding as much as possible while I have the opportunity.
I believe that committing to learning and exploration in the fields and programs I want to familiarize myself with will earn me the future of success and capability I need. I am poor, I am near desperation, and my grasp on my current condition is tenuous. I never want to be in that position again. As such I am striving to learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible. I am trying to learn at an unprecedented rate and an uncomfortable amount. My plan is to learn 8 languages this year, 8 coding languages this year, and to start studying engineering by January of next year. I will be building learning platforms and applications for language and other technical studies. I will empower a generation with the abilities, skills, and knowledge to build their own educational platforms.
